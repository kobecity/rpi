A handful of tools have ignited a hardware revival Arduino, Linux, Python, Make magazine and its fairs, and ever-cheaper 3-D printers, to name a few. Another is the Raspberry Pi, over 5 million of which have now been sold, in just about three years. All 5 million are special, but some are leading very special existences for example, the ones that ended up at a Kids Hacker Camp in Nairobi; the ones that were part of a distributed light control system fitted into a Land Rover Defender that traveled 22,000 km from the UK to South Africa via Russia and the Middle East; the ones that Eric Schmidt and I used to teach a classroom of kids to code, on the occasion of Google donating 15,000 Pis to UK schoolchildren; the ones that are finding their way into computing labs for girls in Afghanistan.</small>

The device was created to help young people learn about programming and to fill this growing technological gap. The Pi has been used variously to create an entertainment centre, a Web server, a synthesiser for music, a 3D printer (which can then be used to print Raspberry Pi parts), and more.To learn more about the Raspberry Pi, visit www.raspberrypi.org.  Dr.Eben Upton is a Technical Director and ASIC computer chip architect for Broadcom. He is also a founder and former trustee of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, responsible for the overall software and hardware architecture of the raspberry Pi device. Along with his colleagues in Cambridge University, Dr. Upton designed this credit card-sized computer to bring affordable programing and multimedia to children, without the usual high cost of computers. He is passionate about the need for society to create and foster Producers rather than Consumers alone.

Chips are down at Broadcom: Thousands of workers laid off
23 Jul 2014 at 01:32, Richard Chirgwin
Broadcom is exiting the cellular baseband business, a decision that's has bitten hard, with the company announcing layoffs of around 2,500 employees ? around 20 per cent of its total workforce ? worldwide.
Its latest SEC filing shows the company turned in a loss of $US1 million for the quarter, a collapse from the previous quarter's $165 million in profit but better than 2013 Q2's $251 million loss.
Following through on its threat to quit the business means the company will take a $417 million restructuring charge, it says, of which $US150 million will be in this quarter.
Of the 2,500 to be laid off, 2,250 are directly in that business, with another 250 in sales, admin and °»other corporate functions°…. Eighteen locations worldwide will be sold or consolidated into other sites, and an unannounced number of contractors will also be pink-slipped.
The company recorded $130 million of non-cash charges covering long-life assets, and $34 million in inventory charges to the end of the quarter, as well as $104 million in property and equipment write-downs.
Broadcom's predicting a rise in WiFi and Bluetooth chip sales in the coming quarter, but CEO Scott McGregor said the baseband cellular division closure will mean total volumes will fall.
McGregor also expects payoffs from the company's moves in the 25 Gbps Ethernet data centre standardisation, and a strong position in the HVEC codec market for Ultra HDTV. Other bright spots, the company hopes, will be automotive and Internet of Things chips. ?

         <br>   &nbsp; 2013/04/02    &nbsp;  In a world full of expensive, 'closed' consumer devices emerges the Raspberry Pi, a low-cost credit-card sized computer that can be plugged into a TV and a keyboard. The hope is to see it being used by kids all over the world to learn programming, but it also serves as an ideal platform for hobbyists to try out new ideas. Eben Upton talks about the transition from large, high performance systems to cheap, low power and potentially disposable hardware. But what does the future hold for these innovative and disruptive products? Will threats to openness result in complete closure of future hardware platforms Join the conversation now:

               <br>   &nbsp; 2012/03/13 &nbsp; The Raspberry Pi personal computer project began 6 years ago at the University of Cambridge in the UK out of a study conducted by Cambridge to discover why incoming students had ever declining programming skills. The study showed that many of the students had no regular access to computers prior to enrolling, a problem that seems to be increasing in families below the poverty level in developed countries. The availability of a fully functioning, low-cost computing system could rapidly close the gap as long as students had the ability to learn how to use them. This interview with foundation executive director Eben Upton, PhD, Computer Sciences at Cambridge, outlines the beginning of the program and where the foundation hopes to go with the technology.

He describes how the goal was to increase the number of applicants to computer science courses at university, but then discovered other markets in the hacking/making communities and in the developing world.  Eben sought knowledge and skills in brand development, partnership working and raising capital by completing the Cambridge Executive MBA at Cambridge Judge Business School.
